As you can see, there are several tabs on the top of the window. Each tab has different functions and options for activating and converting Office 2010. We will explain them in detail below.
 
## Step 3: Activate Office 2010 using KMS
 
The first tab is called "Main". Here you can activate your Office 2010 using KMS. KMS stands for Key Management Service, which is a server-based activation method that allows you to activate multiple computers with a single key. To use KMS, you need to have a KMS host running on your network or connect to a public KMS server on the internet.
 
To activate Office 2010 using KMS, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the "Office" button on the left side of the window. This will show you the information about your Office installation, such as version, edition, license type, activation status, etc.
2. Click on the "EZ-Activator" button on the right side of the window. This will automatically try to find a suitable KMS server and activate your Office 2010. You will see a progress bar and some messages on the bottom of the window.
3. Wait until the process is finished. If everything goes well, you will see a message saying "Office Activation Successful". You can also check the activation status on the "License Status" section.

Congratulations! You have successfully activated your Office 2010 using KMS. However, keep in mind that this activation is not permanent. It will expire after 180 days and you will need to repeat the process again. You can also use the "AutoKMS" option to automatically renew your activation every day.
 
## Step 4: Convert Office 2010 from Retail to Volume License
 
The second tab is called "Activation". Here you can convert your Office 2010 from retail to volume license. Retail versions of Office 2010 require online activation with a unique product key for each computer. Volume license versions of Office 2010 allow offline activation with a generic key for multiple computers.
